description: "Assignment to construct an essay that draws on specific, cross-cultural\
  \ cases to make an argument that addresses the following questions: How does an\
  \ institution\u2019s perception/conception of a \u201Cpopulation\u201D shape the\
  \ way that medical practices and technologies are applied toward that population?\
  \ How do culture, history, politics, and economics influence these dynamics? To\
  \ what degree do individuals have agency or power to resist or use technologies\
  \ and interventions to further their own ends?"
